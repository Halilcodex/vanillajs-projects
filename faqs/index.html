                            The letters (or word) FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. A FAQ page is usually a list of common questions people have asked about a specific product or service.

                            Every business and product website comes with a set of default pages like an “About” page, “Contact” page, “Privacy Policy” page, and more. A FAQ page is one of the few must-have pages on this list.

                            As with many other fields, computer programmer skills can be grouped into hard and soft skills. “Hard skills” refer to measurable abilities that are developed over time through practice or study. “Soft skills,” on the other hand, are abilities that enable people to fit into a working environment or work effectively with others. Here are some of the most important skills to have as a computer programmer.

                            A lot of people start a blog as a way to express their views or as a creative outlet.

                            However, there are many cases of people not only earning a living from their blogs but even turning them into massive companies, like the Huffington Post.
